Sleepwell Selenium Project
A Selenium-based automated testing framework that follows the Page Object Model (POM) with Page Factory and is built using a hybrid framework to test the functionality of the Sleepwell e-commerce website.

Project Features
Page Object Model (POM) with Page Factory for better code maintainability.
Hybrid Framework combining Data-Driven and Keyword-Driven approaches.
Reusable Utility Classes for common operations.
TestNG Integration for structured test execution.
Maven Project Setup for dependency management.
Excel-based Data-Driven Testing using Apache POI.
Logging and Reporting using Extent Reports.

Key Components:
Base Package (com.ust.base) â€“ Contains core framework setup, including configurations and property loaders.
Utility Package (com.ust.executil) â€“ Houses utility classes such as ExcelReader for handling test data.
POM Classes (com.ust.popages) â€“ Separate classes for each web page, encapsulating locators and methods.
Reporting (com.ust.reportutil) â€“ Manages test execution reports with ReportsManager.
Reusable Components (com.ust.reusable) â€“ Contains reusable functions to avoid code duplication.
Test Cases (com.ust.testcases) â€“ Implements automated test scripts using TestNG.
Listeners (com.ust.listener) â€“ Handles TestNG listeners for reporting and logging.
Resource Files (resources) â€“ Stores properties files for element locators and Excel files for data-driven testing.
Maven & TestNG (pom.xml, testng.xml) â€“ Maven for dependency management and TestNG for test execution.
